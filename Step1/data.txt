- Good phone with overpriced value. In my phone there is a display problem,there is a vertical fine line on the display 
- It sucks in short, the screen has a yellowish tinge especially on whites. If you crank up the brightness all the way up to maximum and compare it with any other device it is very clear and evident.
- While the speaker looks like stereo however it's just a single firing front speaker which is not loud compared to other device which are much cheaper
+ expectations of the phone are beyond words liked it and loved it 
- this phone is over heated and then battery is not longer. i want to replace money

- battery backup is extremely bad. mobile is heating too much.
+ Some very Cool Apps from Coolpad, like CoolShow and RockWallpapers  are simply awesome. You will like it.The Cool UI is not that bad. You will get used to it after a week or two. But so far I didn't face any problems. It's very smooth in touch responsiveness.
+ Lots of Coolpad service centres already set up in most cities and they are increasing their numbers too. This is a good sign.ouch is really smooth, more than I expected. 
+ Finger Print Sensor is really works & very reliable. It worked all the time for me. Feels like very efficient and definitely much faster than your expectations.
+ Gives very good photos under day light.In nights only closeup shots appear good.Images are soft and not really sharp.front cam clicks good selfies. Selfie lovers will not be disappointed
+ Good but not the best.its not sharp and not bad either. But other displays is better than this It has led indicator.The Quality of the phone calls is great and also that of the Music and gaming sounds
+ The Ear phones are of good quality and i detected no problem in the ear phones.it  is a good smart phone in the view of price segment.
+ The Phone looks great and also light in weight. The package given by the coolpad was excellent and very hard and this kind of packaging protects the mobile and its accessories very well. The Phone is slim and lengthy. Overall the looks are great
- Back Cover is of very bad quality. Cheap plastic is used. It could have been better. Touch capacitive buttons does not have backlit. It becomes hard to make out in dark or at night.
- Battery is good but could have been better. A faster charging option could have solved the purpose.Screen protector film missing. It is mentioned in the Box contents.
- Experienced heating while playing all sorts of games . I don't play much games though. Also getting hot while charging & using the phone simultaneously. This is really a big sacrifice that you have to make. 
+ Some usefull pre-installed softwares like fingerprint lock for apps, multiuser option and c floating button which is useful for one handed operation in 5.5 inch device
- Apps there is no option to move app to sd card. No proper Specification and features guide available on internet or within the box
+ Power packed hardware including 3GB RAM, Ram management is good in this phone, I loved it. finger print sensor is really fast
+ slim, comfortable to hold in hand, premium look,Back panel is super soft, but it is white, dirt, oil, water can can make it dirty
+ The Price, at this price point this much of hardware configuration and features realy good Sound quality is quite loud and good
- Heating Issue, It heat up that much after or during play games, if got any call in between playing game, its unbearable to put. this phone fails in expectations
- I have set default storage location and App installation setting to SD Card but they are installing in internal memory of phone. Apps there is no option to move app to sd card.
- No proper Specification and features guide available on internet or within the box Also I set custom ringtone for Sim 1, but when phone rings it rings with default coolpad ringtone.
- its unbearable to put Rear Camera with 13 MP is not as per expectations, but that can be ignored,
+ Sound quality is quite loud and goodMacro shots are good from back camera, zoom is also good.Multiwindow option is there
+ features really good, Sound quality is quite loud and goodMacro shots are good from back camera, zoom is also good.Multiwindow option double tap to wake up phone NEG glass which is scratch resistant and tough to break.
+ easy availability of genuine Accessories Cool new feature in this, marshmallow update is available
+ The phone has got good display even it is only an HD display. The display looks quite vivid and colorful.Sound quality is quite loud and good.
+ The performance was smooth and I have never faced any kind of lag whatsoever. Also the fingerprint works like the company has claimed and you will be able to unlock the phone in less than 0.5 sec
+ I liked the selfie camera more than its front facing camera as it was better than my expectation. The power management is ok and it will be able to carry out 1 full day with light to moderate usage
- Although the phone has a decent build quality, still it does not look premium. The back panel is plastic and is prone to smudges and dirt.
- while handling you have to be careful. The biggest disappointment is the front facing camera.
- Don't get me wrong. You can click good pics, however you need to have steady hand. I am no photographing expert but still I think the software needs to be upgraded to take the full potential of the camera
- There is little lag in focusing the object. However, the outdoor pic was nice. The indoor pic was ok as on zooming it will get grainy.
- There is no battery management feature and you can't uninstall the bloatware. I still need to check whether we can move the app to SD. The sound quality was ok and there is nothing to brag about.
+ overall the phone is very good with the price with which it has been offered. It could have been the best phone in this segment provided coolpad takes care of some minor issues.
- bought the mobile with bigger expectations since it has got impressive specifications. But the phone is a mixed performer.
+ The Fingerprint sensor is the highlight of this phone and it is awesome. This is the cheapest phone which comes with Fingerprint sensor. The apps can also be locked specifically using the fingerprint sensor.
- The Camera is the biggest issue with the phone. The camera UI has only few manual settings. Even the image quality can't be changed manually which is mostly available in all mobile phones.
- In clear bright sun light the camera gives wonderful images like higher end devices. But in the indoor, even in very good lighting conditions, the camera struggles. The image gets blurred.
- The Front camera is not good at all. Only in bright sun light, it captures 5 MP resolution images. In low light and indoor the front camera performance is worst.
+ No heating issues even after using continuously for several hours. It is also a big point of this phone. Call quality is good.
- i am disappointed with the heating problem. Its just 2 days am using n the heating at the finger print sensor n camera is so much that does not allow us to use phone. It has to get cooled then can be used.
+ UI is cool. Camera is good. Front is also good. Sound clarity n output is good. Phone is handy even it being 5.5" screen .Screen resolution is awesome.
+ RAM is great. Should have provided screen guard n a back cover as they r not available out side. At least screen guard as others are providing.
- this is bad as it is getting heated even in normal usage. If this continues for more time then will have to return the product n wait for something good.
- When it was new work properly but after three months battery backup is not good hanging issue, When phone is hang no one keys are working we cant switch off as well so i have to wait till it work again, apps are automatically closed while using.
+ Good Mobile phone for around 9K .I love this phone immensely. Worth a lot.
+ So i have been using this for 3 months and it is fantastic o absolutely adore it. you will not get anything better for this price range . i assure you
+ Excellent budget phone that can compete with high end branded phone. Camera good, only video quality is very poor
+ Its a very good mobile in Budget range. The battery life is good for moderate gaming and moderate use. The touch is very smooth, the display is also nice but needs more brightness level in sunshine.
+ The rear camera is gives u a nice daylight pics but decent low light pictures. The front camera is just awesome far better than rear camera. The close shots in rear cam are awesome and gives better color reproduction.
+ The is bit of focusing issue at low light while video recording but superb in daylight.Accurate finger print sensor which gives quick access we can open other app with touch
+ My first impression , Awesome. Will write more after having used it for a longer period. The finger print sensor is so quick and so convenient. you can use it to easily lock access
- I wanted an economical smart phone to serve as a backup smartphone so I bought this for a lot and I regret it big time. Though it has 512MB RAM but I thought it would serve my purpose due to its quad core processor, but it doesn't.
- have only installed whatsapp as an extra application apart from the factory apps but even then it is slow.
- Every time I restart the phone it takes a couple of minutes. Opening google maps is a nightmare. Overall this product is a complete waste of money
- this product is a complete waste of money. I m not satisfied with product that u given by u. Some more work expected on that piece. Stylish but not adorable. I m unhappy.
- phone is always hanging in middle of using apps I have only installed what's app and news paper app. it is not as expected 
- this is so beautiful android phone . It is really smart phone I love it so much .It's colour white Is good. Looks very interesting. Love this series
+ it is definitely giving tough competition to my favourite before this. Definitely better price to performance, or so it seems. I chose this one over that due to the fingerprint sensor
+ But above the all fingerprint scanner was exceptionally good. Nothing comes close to this machine.I tried in all possible ways keeping my finger and it just in half of a second it recognize. that was cool.No more remembering PIN's lol. guys no worries your better half cant open the phone with out your finger lol
+ Average sound reproduction via headset. its loud but not clear, but though i tried using my headphones it was incredibly awesome. 
+ UI is good with some good features like multitasking as two opened can be allowed at time. but I found one issue so far Except Gmail other account like Hotmail contacts and calendar can not synched in the contacts.
- Phone gets heated while calling, we cannot even keep near ears more than 5 min. We should always use headphones.Display is average. 
+ Sound quality is good in headphones but not good in speakers. Call quality is good. Battery is good.
+ Product does not look premium but okay for the price With this Price, If any one is excited for finger printer scanner , than only go for this mobile
- 'm disappointed for buying this phone. The phone don't have sound at all! I tried my best to repair the phone but because of online product 
- I had taken the phone to other service center. They tried a lot but it does not working! I tried to return the phone but time bound don't allowed me to send the phone. So I just wasted my money for such a defective product. 
+ Everything is good but I think the earpiece volume is a bit less. I have to press the mobile to my ear to listen nicely 
+ it's a decent phone for this price, no complaints really. However, I have been trying to get a screen guard and back cover for this phone in the shops and nobody seems to have it.
+ For this price it is a good buy. bought it for my family.don't expect to be gaming on this or and high processor operation.its good to gift anyone
- when I started the phone, it felt like the phone was an INR 1K phone. The quality of the phone was very bad. 
- The quality of the phone was very bad. The screen particularly was terrible. There was no clarity, the colours were very faint, and the screen was terribly directional
- if I looked at the screen from a particular angle, then only it would look okay. Just a slight change of angle would cause it to look very bad. There is screen guard in the box. It makes the screen worse.
- a visual pattern starts appearing on top of the screen which makes it very uncomfortable to look at the screen. And the second terrible thing is the camera. The manufacturer claims that the rear camera is 3.2 MP camera.but it is not.
- quality of the pictures it clicks is so terrible, you won't be able to tell a car apart from a tree. i immediately returned it
- Big disappointment , i purchase this mobile as gift for my mother but after 25 days this mobile is not working in proper way .
- When i tried to return or replace this product with other / better mobile then i found i am not eligible for this option .
- I feel cheated and disappointed . I am ready to pay more to get the better and quality product but i am not able to find the option . 
- Too poor performance. Phone is getting hanged and switched off automatically after few days. During voice call some times gets call hold automatically.
+ According to price every thing gud except camera. At night camera cannot take picture clearly, it is worst at nights, even in daylight mode it is not good.
+ It was good as i expected.it has good touch performance.and a good 3.2MP camera and the performance of phone is also good.battery backup is less not work full one day
- The charger doesn't work. The phone was a gift to someone and she is already using it. We wanted to exchange only the charger and get a working one but that was not allowed. I wish you were ready to provide us a working charger in place of the damaged one we received.
- The battery was defective when I got the product. So I had to returned it for replacement.  The new one I got for the replacement is working fine without an issue.
+ Excellent budget phone that can compete with high end branded phone. Camera good, only video quality is very poor
+ it is having good battery life and also performance is so smoothly and also especially thanks for providing the finger print sensor its working very smoothly. Big battery backup.  
+ Looks like high end phone. runs very smoothly. It has super clear screen. Camera is good, battery is good, touch is so responsive. Overall great value for money.
+ Nice budgeted phone. Purchased one for my dad and he is happy with the huge screen size , 3 GB RAM, and finger print scanner is excellent
+ Camera is good, gives good quality images in light. Display is also good at this price. Earphones and sound is great. Body does not look premium but specs are great.
+ thank you to Amazon for this very good products thank you too fast delivery it is a very good phone its cameras also very brilliant and very good battery 
- I am pretty disappointed with the camera of the phone. The camera is like a typical cheap Chinese mobiles camera and the photos lack detail and look overexposed
- Apart from camera phone heats up fast if playing heavy as well as normal games. Performance is pretty awesome because I don't find any lack while using for almost a week
+ Nothing is getting heated up in general use except fingerprint scanner.Fingerprint scanner good. We can say coolpad made fingerprint scanner as stand out spec in there profile
- moment I hold coolpad i really first very uncomfortable but after one day I realized coolpad very comfortable and light weighted.
- Mobile is of average performance, highly unfit for usage of internet using mobile data. If you are using mobile data phone is getting heated too much and battery is draining.
- When i contacted customer care of Coolpad, they say 45 deg is common temp any android phone will get heated, so heating upto 45 deg we have to accept with Coolpad Charger they supplied was burnt within 15 days and of no use. Some time play store also hangs.
- Only good about this phone is good speed because of 3gb ram and finger print sensor. Heating complaint needs to be addressed, the soft buttons are invisible during night.
+ I am satisfied with this phone there some minor cons first I got the package I opened that time I see back camera have a small scratch. It's fine to me. Headset design is extremely good
- camera new update solved daylight Time it's good quality some time heating little and temperature not going down to 29°c in standby mode
- Heating Issue, It heat up that much after or during play games, if got any call in between playing game, its unbearable to put phone on ear. Suggest you use earphone or use on speaker while its heated up.
+ Large 5.5 inch screen which is super tough and high intensity scratch resistant, really I find its display screen need not any kind of scratch protector or coating, what it has it is best.
+ 13 Mp rear camera is average but 5MP front camera is good finger print sensor is really fast slim, comfortable to hold in hand, premium look,
+ Cool UI is cool, but more R&d needed, to could be made better . Back panel is super soft, but it is white, dirt, oil, water can can make it dirty
- I have set default storage location and App installation setting to SD Card but they are installing in internal memory of phone.  Apps there is no option to move app to sd card.
- No proper Specification and features guide available on internet or within the box. Also I set custom ringtone for Sim 1, but when phone rings it rings with default coolpad ringtone.
- Rear Camera with 13 MP is not as per expectations, but that can be ignored, But most of the issues can be resolved after software update,
+ overall camera performance is termed as average by other users bt its not true i have got u an solution for the rear camera . Front is awesome.
+ The camera quality is really good.it is an extremely awesome  phone at this price
+ One of the best mobile phones that you would find in today's current market under 10K. Tested it using 10-15 applications at a time and this beast is strong enough is take everything that comes its way without any lag in the performance.
+ The fingerprint scanner is at par with any of the high end devices and it could detect and authenticate in less than half a second
- I Have Purchase this phone, after 3 Months Android UI Is not Supported please don't Purchase this phone because i have very bad experience using this phone
- i am disappointed for buying this phone. The phone don't have sound at all. I tried my best to repair the phone but because of online service center not ready to repair the phone
- Handset was not in working condition, blank white screen appeared even after charging the battery, so returned the item.it hangs sometimes
+ The mobile is awesome in this price though hangs sometimesNice for the price...at this range I won't get anything better. so am satisfied
+ Nice phone. Only drawback that you don't get the phone case for this model.Best phone in 3000 for normal use great
+ Working perfectly in all respect. Very very good product considering the price of 3K. Delivery is very fast. Highly recommend to purchase for specially senior citizens
- Today I got delivered the phone and I charged for 3hours and removed and i slept .when I woke up I got shocked the charging remaining was too low without using anything the phone was just kept in stand . the battery is very bad
+ i like this product, very much,touch is very nice and smooth , phone is to very slim, camera and all features good, in very low price,AND one Drawback call attend voice sound low
- I got the phone very cheap for INR 3K. However, when I started the phone, it felt like the phone was an INR 1K phone. The quality of the phone was very bad
- The screen particularly was terrible. There was no clarity, the colours were very faint, and the screen was terribly directional.
- This the 1st time I'm totally Not happy with this product because both phone is dead after few days. very upset about the product
+ its a great product at this price .only problem is no accessories are available for this particular type product.
- it is very bad mobile i am using this phone,this order came to my last month. and this automatically switched off again and again, i want to return this 
- Within six months it stopped working. I approached to authorised service centre, but they told me that its seal is broken hence I shall have to pay full charges
+ The device has had no issues with heating as of now. The battery works wonders. A full charge in the morning will end the day with almost half charge remaining 
+ It comes with Gorilla glass 3 and aluminium chassis which gives brilliant resistance to damage due to fall and scratches. A headset, USB data cable and charger comes along with the phone in the box. 
+ A amazing phone at a good budget, overall performance is good display is above average there are many software glitches but it is manageable
+ only shortfall i found on this were the vibration and the software, But there are a lot of features that the phone offers for the price, the final decision depends on personal preference 
+ if you are a person that prefers a perfect phone without any flaws this is not for you but if you are ready to make minor compromises for more features then consider it as a buying option
+ finger print scanner was amazing ,other features like double click to wake up, short cuts to open apps from lock screen, were all good and useful
- I got it last day ,please do not take very bad product . does not support 3G, automatically switch off, ear sound horrible, you can't share apps or take from other.
- But battery.is poor has to charge twice in a day. Phone gets heated soon during talks or net use.. Otherwise it is good as smart phone in low cost.
- Touch is not good as expected. Display is dull. Camera is not at all useful. User interface sucks,need to install launcher which eats ram
- We don't want this Mobile because we are taking a different and high quality. We don't want this Mobile please cancel my order
+ Just an awesome phone at an unbelievable price. Gives a straight knock to those low budget phones having similar specs,not a single lag
+ it does not heats up on multitasking. Coming to the cameras....8MP rear shooter is super fine in quality. Clicks in Macro mode too. Colors and saturation are just intact.
+ Display is Really good, high pixel density display that never puts you off as long as you keep it on auto-brightness and let it do its magic in different ambient settings. 
+ I was keen on getting a device with a lasting battery but this is a massive powerhouse when it comes to battery.
+ Good phone with good battery and reasonably good features for ok price which I purchased.Complete cheating to genuine customers keeping in mind off late customers buying  online
- using very old android version.till now not yet released the update. Main disadvantage is we can't move apps frm phone memory to secondary memory.
- In my phone there is a display problem,there is a vertical fine line on the display appears from the phone I started.
+ Nice mobile, price worthy, good working, specified 13mp rear camera not upto the mark, fast delivery thanks to amazon, inbuilt apps are very useful, universal remote is very nice, battery back up is satisfactory.
- I bought this phone 10 days before today.and now i m very disappointed on my decision.1st time i am using andriod phone. phone is good.but there are some problems
- Not as expected ok. Camera is not too good. Touch sense also not upto d mark. With in 2 days mobile got hang for 5 times. No battery back up. Totaly not satisfied
+ Nice Touch with Octa Core Processor and Gesture Settings and its very user friendly. No hanging Problems or Heating Problems only thing is takes time for getting the phone
+ Good camera quality(both rear nd front),good speakers,decent battery.Good deal at this price.
+ Very nice phone on this rate except camera quality everything is superb both front and back camera was not clear. Battery back up is fair for normal 3g use
+ This is an amazing phone that gives you excellent performance at optimal cost. Ever since I started using the phone I hardly had any reason to complain
+ Superb speed, never hung so far. This should be a must buy for people looking for optimized features at an extremely competitive price.
- Using these phone for past month little problems that it may hang at some times.battery only average when using data usage dries, as normal android phone
- touch not too good. GUI average only. worth for cameras at these price and good working.
+ Trusting this was a great decision. awesome phone. camera clarity n front flash. just loving it.best phone at this price.
+ It is good at price level, compromise at camera quality, battery good, phone call sound is little bit low to compare other phones.
- it was a huge mistake buying this phone. the contact list keeps appearing and disappearing. the charger and ear phone have already departed
- The camera clarity is horrible. speed is too slow. you need to restart it minimum 10times a day. average product with a cheap price 
- Within a few days the Glossy finish of the Phone started peeling. Due to the limited return policy of the phone, the phone cannot be exchanged and we are at a loss. 
- Night and flash photographs VERY poor and grainy. Makes u feel like u r using some VGA CAMERA and shooting. only under exceptional lighting conditions take photos with this phone.
- The first 2 nights I charged it fully and for the next 2 days the battery seem to last barely a day. So I was pretty pissed. They've got to cut the cost somewhere
- Do not buy this phone. It's a fine phone but the glossy finish (paint) will start coming off in about 10 days and will look like it's months old.
- Better to save some more money and buy another, better phone. Don't waste your money on this. There's a reason why people don't this
- Phone is Good no problem after six months use but quality of screen in not that good if you see other android device it is a normal use phone not for heavy gamers
+ it actually fits perfect and didnt need any instructional video to apply it. really makes it fun using the phone without worrying about scratches.
- It doesn't fit properly as the air droplets remains inside. And for this problem only I purchased it twice but the problem persist.
+ It certainly seems to have protected the main screen of the phone. My phone has fallen twice and there is a crack in the glass but everything is working perfectly
+ There is no heating problem at all... You can do any heavy tasks and run even 1 GB games without lags. Android version is not upgradable which is sad
- it is a big disappointment waiting for you , screen brightness like old CRT tv , Texts and images are so pixelized. software and build quality ok 
+ Excellent Product with great looks, design and speed is too good. Battery capacity is average and its not a concern ,it not for playing games. Camera quailty is Good.
- I buy in Amazon when I buy music speak is not working. My friends told me that in HTC music will play in both top and bottom for me 1ly bottom is working
- First impression was very good but after 6 month this phone with watsapp ,hike and amazazn application getting slow 
- i purchased this phone few days back, but i am not able to connect it with wifi. It always shows saved,secured with WPA but could not connect. 
+ Excellent phone at 7.5 k price range. All aspects are at par excellence. Will be greedy if we expect more at this price range. 
+ I'm using mobile without any pouch and Externally phone is strong though it's back cover is of plastic. Performance wise is good. The size of the screen 4.7 inch is handy, not too big 
+ It's a nice phone according to its price. Has good camera also and speed is also nice. No defect and I m using it from approximately one year. One should buy this phone
- Within this price you can buy Samsung phone which is far better than this one. So many small small irritating features in this phone.This phone is not user friendly .
- Product is behaving as expected. Though all thing works properly except dialer function.It's behaving abnormally, when data connection is on.At that time it's response is very poor, which is enough to irritating someone
+ Awesome product, features packed at unbeatable price. Good battery back-up and very good rear and front camera. No hang so far, no unusual heating
+ Absolutely amazing phone for 7000/-, great camera , high memory storage space. The only drawback is that you can't transfer apps to sd card
- Found the device cracked. Also, ringtone found to be soft. Hence I requested for cancellation and return. I was not happy with the device.
- Camera quality at average . which is not good. Heating issue- not a major issue at all.there's not much heating until and unless you are running some high end game.
+ i was thinking that this phone is good at this price range but processor isnt very good but after using this phone 
- worst product. After using it for 2-3 months it is getting over heated due to getting overheated the glossy finish of back panel is getting pealed off  also it hangs
+ Nice phone within 8000. Rear camera is fine and the front camera is pretty average within the amount. But I'm highly disappointed with the sound quality
- Highly unsatisfactory phone, . seller had sent me a refurbished phone ,it's not working properly
+ Very good phone at such low price from htc. Fast Processor presence is really felt. Back side cover glossy coating is not good
- I dont think this is good quality glass. It cracked even before I could use it. I kept it in my car for 2 days and the next day I found the glass cracked.
+ Mobile Look is Super. Touch is also Super. Rear Camera Good. Front Camera also Very Good. But If you use continuously 10 to 15 Minutes Phone gets Hot
- Very poor quality. Touchscreen became unresponsive and buggy after applying.Poor quality Finger print magnet. I would not recommend for this product.Don't buy
+ Great product ,though the fitting could have been better.it doesn't cover the entire screen which caused proximity sensor issues while unlocking the device
+ A great Phone at this price. Just got yesterday and everything seems fine. The phone performance is very good and it easily handles multitasking
+ The fingerprint sensor works as expected and gaming performance is also very good.Camera is also very good but don't expect it to be like the premium phones. Build Quality is top notch
+ Battery backup is also pretty good. Till now no complaints, but yeah takes little time to charge to full capacity and the headset provided is not great
- Very bad, Not at all happy about this product. Camera quality is average, battery require long time to charge and battery back up is average.
- Very feeble ring tone volume and speaker phone voice. Never expected such poor quality voice.  i am not satisfied with it because it was clearly mentioned that the gadget contains 4GB of internal space although it was not the case and it consist of only 1GB space. 
- This item is not working good. Here is problems of sound first thing is that it's speakers is damage today and second one is it's voice is too low 
- too much heating while charging, talking, down loading or any other thing we do on this phone. This phone wont last1 year and then I have to look into some other good options
+ Its an excellent phone to buy.Look at the specifications of the phone in just 6000/-. When an Indian company can make this phone in this price range.
