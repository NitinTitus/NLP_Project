The file <b>Multinomial_nb_model.py</b> contains the code for training and generating the multinomial naive bayesian model. It takes any training set as input and generates a model from it. <br />
The file <b>vocabulary_positive.txt</b> contains the words occuring in positive documents and their corresponding frequencies<br />
The file <b>vocabulary_negative.txt</b> contains the words occuring in negative documents and their corresponding frequencies<br />
The files <b>positive.pickle</b> and <b>negative.pickle</b> contains the saved models with each word and its corresponding probability of occuring in a document of that particular class i.e. positive or negative<br />
